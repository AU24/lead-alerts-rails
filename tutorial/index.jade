      ## What Are We Building?

      You probably already have landing pages or product detail views in your
      web application, which you're using to generate leads for your business. 
      In this tutorial, we'll use Twilio SMS to send a message when a new lead
      is found.

      ![Lead Alerts Flow](//s3.amazonaws.com/howtodocs/lead-alerts-flow.png)

      In this example we'll be implementing instant lead alerts for real estate
      (much like [our awesome friends at
      Trulia](//www.twilio.com/customers/stories/trulia)). We'll create a
      landing page for a new house on the market, and notify a real estate agent
      the moment a potential customer requests information. 

      Let's see how it works! Click the next arrow above to continue the tutorial.

      ## Landing Page Data

      To display a landing page for our house, we'll first need some data about
      the fictional house we've put on the market. For demonstration purposes,
      we've hard-coded a hash containing information we need.

      ## Rendering the Landing Page

      In our HAML template, we insert data about the house, and in a sidebar
      include a form for the user to enter in their contact information to
      request more info about the home.

      ## Creating a Twilio REST API Client

      Here we create a helper class with an authenticated Twilio REST
      API client that we can use anytime we need to send a text message. We
      initialize it with our [Twilio Account Credentials](//www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dashboard) 
      stored as environment variables.

    :markdown
      ## Handling the POST Request

      This code handles the HTTP `POST` request issued by our landing page. It 
      uses our `MessageSender` class to send a SMS message to the real estate 
      agent's phone number, which is also set as a environment variable. We 
      include the lead's name, phone number, and inquiry directly in the body of 
      the text message we send to the agent.

      Now the agent has all the information they need to immediately follow up on the lead.

      That's it! We've just implemented an application to instantly route leads
      to sales people using text messages. If you're a
